# Experience
## Xi'An GrapeCity (July 2017 ~ June 2021)
### Core developer for [BI](https://www.grapecity.com.cn/solutions/wyn) project
Build the project from the ground up, contribute to core features, includes Advanced Chart, Dashboard Layout, Data Engine...

### Data Engin
  * **V1**(out-of-date): basic aggregation in backend + further calculation in frontend.
    * Maintain the frontend calculation engine
  * **V2**(in-used): specs in JSON -> query data by SQL.
    * Design the JSON and corresponding SQL
    * Design the SQL generation steps for given JSON
    * Refactor and implement frontend parts
  * **V3**(in-develop): DAX like expression in frontend -> query data by SQL.
    * Learn DAX in depth
    * Research possible solutions

### Dashboard Layout
* **Complex**: Web/Mobile, Overlapping, Manual/Auto, Snap to Grid/Chart, Group/Container, ...
* **Solutions**:
  * Refer to [maximal rectangle](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/), improve dnd performance.
  * Separate dnd component from normal flow, provide smooth dnd experience.
  * Abstract complexity into JSON config to provide powerful layout with friendly API

### Advanced Chart
Advanced Chart = Chart + Enhanced Function
* **Design**: Similar to HOC, lift the chart lifecycle
* **Implement**:
  * Lift the definition, model, render of charts
  * Hijack aggregation flow to inject new data
  * Reuse chart logic as much as possible
* **Samples**
  * CalcChart: data comes from aggregation and user input
  * CombineChart: data comes from combined aggregations
